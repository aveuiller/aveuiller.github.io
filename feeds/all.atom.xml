&lt;p&gt;This article presents the core concepts behind a well-designed system. I will focus on distributed web services, as they are the most present systems nowadays. As before, the concepts can be used for any other kind of software system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="goals-of-a-distributed-system"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals of a Distributed System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed system aims to maximize availability, reliability and performance through well-known concepts that you will need to consider while designing a system. For a start, let’s define those goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability:&lt;/strong&gt; The capacity of your system to keep working at any time, even if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; The capacity for things to not go wrong on your system during a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; The capacity of your system to work quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, there is a correlation between reliability and availability, but the concepts should not be confused. A system with poor availability will probably be unreliable, but an unreliable system can sometimes remain available given enough resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="availability"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Availability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep a system available, the main concept to keep in mind is &lt;em&gt;redundancy.&lt;/em&gt; In a perfect world, everything in your system should be duplicated in order to palliate a dysfunction. Fortunately, thanks to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/geekculture/towards-abstraction-of-computer-science-cc68e4c30654"&gt;abstraction of computer science&lt;/a&gt;, you will be able to rely on the availability of the underlying systems you use, namely for cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your side of the system, availability will be mainly driven by using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/"&gt;load balancing&lt;/a&gt; in front of your services, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/database-replication"&gt;replication&lt;/a&gt; for your databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The load balancing will redirect calls directed towards any service to a reliably working instance. This keeps your service responding even if a few instances are down. It also optimizes the load received by each instance, hence can impact positively the performances of your services. The load balancer is a component of our system, and as such we also need to create multiple instances of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replication on a database system intends to keep your data safe from system failure, and also improve access capabilities through load balancing. Depending on the data criticality, you may also consider replicating your data on multiple physical locations. This is becoming easier thanks to cloud providers and can be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="reliability"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability won’t necessarily be represented by actual components. However, there are some actionable that can help to ensure the production of a reliable system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For service to remain reliable in the long run, it should be maintainable. Maintainability comes with clean code and a sensible codebase size. A service doing too many things will cost a lot to scale and may become cumbersome to maintain. While services too atomic will add complexity to your deployments and debugging processes. Uber published a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://eng.uber.com/microservice-architecture/"&gt;good article&lt;/a&gt; on the advantages of finding the right sizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="performances"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of a distributed is to ease the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.section.io/blog/scaling-horizontally-vs-vertically/"&gt;horizontal scaling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; adding more instances of a service to serve more requests. This means that your services can evolve independently depending on their load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, scaling is a costly solution, and even if it can help for short-term spikes, you may want to try optimizing before resorting to it in the long run. If you intend to send a lot of times the same data, the main way of improving your performance will be through using a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/caching"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cache&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cache is basically storing the results of a request, and sending this result to any further request that matches, until invalidation. It will be your main ally to reduce loads over services and databases but may be counterproductive for queries that are requiring live data, as you want to see the changes and not be locked on a snapshot. A good example of a cached system is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content Delivery Network&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CDN), which is widely used to deliver static content as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of a single component becomes more and more important with the number of dependencies others have on it. A component that becomes central in your architecture is named a &lt;em&gt;Single Point Of Failure&lt;/em&gt; (SPOF). A SPOF will slow or bring down all your system if it has performance issues. You may want to avoid those as much as possible, but if that is a requirement of your systems, take extra care of the performance and availability of this component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="distributed-system-template"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distributed System Template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to apply the three concepts above, the main course of action is to almost always have at least two instances of each component. You may also need to push it further by having instances of each component in at least two geographical regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to do so, your software should be stateless as much as possible, having a state will significantly increase the complexity of replicating components across multiple instances of regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following schema represents a template of a system designed to be available, reliable, and performant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QMfcuCYGKMiQqKUNIEAv-A.png" /&gt;Detailed Typical Distributed System ArchitectureIn this design, the &lt;em&gt;API Gateway&lt;/em&gt; have the advantage of providing a single, standardized, entry point on both sides of communications. For instance, you can use the gateway to provide an authentication layer on every incoming request, making it easier for services to handle authorization levels. On the other hand, you may have recognized a &lt;em&gt;SPOF&lt;/em&gt; in this component. If the gateway goes down, your entire infrastructure will be unavailable, making the component critical in regard to code quality and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ensure-that-the-goals-are-reached"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ensure That The Goals Are Reached&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure that your system is indeed up to standard, you will need to monitor its behaviour in real time. Hopefully, a lot of tools exist to do so, exporting metrics, logs, and traces from your software and underlying systems. Depending on your needs, you can rely on open-source software like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://prometheus.io/"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://grafana.com/"&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt;, or enterprise solutions like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/"&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a well-designed observability stack above your systems will help you pin down issues with more ease, thus greatly &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aveuiller.medium.com/a-generic-approach-to-troubleshooting-dda764fbbb6"&gt;improving your response time in case of any issue on your system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet in system design. However, it can be helpful to have a template in mind whenever designing a new system. This will help efficiently create something relevant with only a few tweaks depending on the requirements of your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said before, this template design is highly personal and may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we defined the coarse-grained design, let’s discuss the details. First, we will see how to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations to scale correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pe9aftaGRqQKCiW_trG_bA.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/illustration-document-icon_2945058.htm#page=1&amp;amp;amp;query=contract&amp;amp;amp;position=3"&gt;Designed by rawpixel.com / Freepik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for any project, before digging into the technicals you need to define your goal clearly. This means defining the features, the interactions, as well as the metrics to declare the project a success. The more you formalize your specifications, the more data you will have to work with during the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is not specific to distributed systems and can be applied to any kind of project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="define-features-through-intended-user-experience"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define Features Through Intended User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any application solves an initial &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;, the term being used here in a broad sense. It can vary from very concrete (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; generating subtitles from a video) to more abstract ideas (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; improving privacy on the internet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first operation to perform here will be to uniformize all problems to concrete and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://iq-inc.com/writing-meaningful-user-stories/"&gt;meaningful user stories&lt;/a&gt;. As the name hints, those stories should always start from the point of view of your users since you are designing the application for them. &lt;em&gt;A user story will take the form of “As a …, I want to … so that …”&lt;/em&gt;.As a side note, starting from the customer's point of view is the first &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles"&gt;principle of Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and is often relayed as the key to their success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a list of applicable user stories, you need to sort the stories into two categories: the ones critical to your application (a.k.a. must have) and those that can wait before being integrated (a.k.a. nice to have). The collection of your &lt;em&gt;must-have&lt;/em&gt; stories will constitute the minimal viable product (MVP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note For Interviews:&lt;/em&gt; The MVP should be defined along with the interviewer, which will select a scope of features that can be analyzed during the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="extract-components-from-created-domains"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extract Components From Created Domains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your user stories, you should be able to group features semantically tied together. Such a group can be considered as a domain in the concepts of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html"&gt;Domain-Driven Design&lt;/a&gt;. The number of domains depends solely on the complexity of your project and there is no silver bullet when it comes to separating a project into domains. Too many domains can slow down your development and make it cumbersome, while too few puts you at risk of having tightly coupled code, which decreases maintainability in the long run. Usually, starting with a few domains is the right call, as it will help you quickly draft your system while giving you time to find the right abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extraction of domains will define the segregated components in your software that should communicate through a public interface. Nowadays, this is often represented as independent micro-services, but it can also simply be done through packages inside the same component of a monolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; The choice is not critical at this point, but the advantages and drawbacks of each architecture are discussed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://articles.microservices.com/monolithic-vs-microservices-architecture-5c4848858f59"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture&lt;/em&gt; by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&amp;#64;antonkharenko?source=post_page-----5c4848858f59--------------------------------"&gt;Anton Kharenko&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="explicit-contracts-between-components"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Explicit Contracts Between Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to be clear from the beginning about your system's public inputs and outputs. On top of the interactions with the end-user, every interaction between domains should be considered a public interaction. Hence, a contract should exist defining common methods and data models for communication. Those interactions can take multiple forms depending on the implementation, so the interaction contracts can be formatted with abstract model definitions at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public models will usually match the internal ones, and it could be enticing to use the same models with both private and public code. However, the internal model will most likely change over time, and potentially break compatibility with the existing contract. To ensure that external interactions will not be affected by such changes, you should segregate internal and external representations of your domain. One way of ensuring this is using a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_%28software%29"&gt;hexagonal architecture&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_%28software%29"&gt;Netflix wrote a very informative post&lt;/a&gt; about their migration to such architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of representation, let’s consider a web service accessible through both a user interface on a browser and an API. The reason why the API should not change is pretty clear, even if you can change the web interface according to your new API, if you do not hold a clear and immutable contract, customers will have trouble keeping their scripted calls alive. In the same fashion, interactions between your components are the same. Indeed, when your application will grow, you may have different teams working on each component, one team becoming the customer of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EpL1Wfbl-aZ8H2Kpf9-o9A.png" /&gt;Example of Interactions in a Distributed System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="build-the-present-keep-an-eye-on-the-future"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build the Present, Keep an Eye on the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if they are not implemented at the moment, the &lt;em&gt;nice-to-have&lt;/em&gt; user stories are important in a way. They define the long-term goal you want to achieve and could be significant while defining the technological stack or integrating some &lt;em&gt;must-have&lt;/em&gt; user stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a trivial example, let’s say that we want to integrate a feature transforming &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;.svg&lt;/span&gt; files to &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;.png&lt;/span&gt;. Maybe this is the only transformation that will take place ever in the project, in which case it’s fine to do a specific implementation. On the other hand, you may have planned to transform multiple formats to &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;.png&lt;/span&gt;. In this case, you will most likely consider a modular approach from the start, to reduce the cost of further integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it will be too costly to prepare for the future, and that’s okay, as long as you are aware of the technical debt you create and integrate the cost of removing this debt in future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="define-metrics-to-assert-success"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define Metrics to Assert Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining the right metrics is critical to know the health of your project, both on the technical and applicative side. It will give you directions to further enhance your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the technical side, you can consider some out-of-the-box metrics. For instance, Google defines the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals"&gt;Golden Signals&lt;/a&gt; as Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation. A view on at least those four metrics should give a good status of the application’s technical health at any time, and combining them with alerts will help you keep your business available and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the applicative side, the metrics will be more specific to the features. The main objective will be to ensure that the users are using the features as expected, in other words, that you correctly foresaw their needs and that your design is intuitive. Among the tips that are usually given, the ones that seem the most important are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a few metrics, if not only one. Too many of them may be correlated and less actionable if you have mixed signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid metrics that are here to make you feel good but give no real insight into your product's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a hard subject to master, so I can only recommend you to dive deeper into the subject, starting with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zepel.io/blog/measure-metrics-for-feature-success/"&gt;How To Measure The Success Of Your Feature?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/defining-product-success-metrics-and-goals"&gt;Defining Product Success: Metrics and Goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw the non-technical decision process to make while designing a system. This process will end up creating features that should mostly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initiate from a customer need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep It Simple, Stupid&lt;/em&gt; principle&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a feedback loop to detect issues and improve usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will end up with a set of contracts that you will have to honour during the next step: the technical design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OwofP5Q14C6hxzSCcsPbbg.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fr.freepik.com/vecteurs-libre/minuscules-personnes-testant-assurance-qualite-dans-logiciel-isole-illustration-vectorielle-plane-personnage-dessin-anime-fixant-bogues-dans-peripherique-materiel-test-application-concept-service-informatique_10613736.htm#page=1&amp;amp;amp;query=software%20system&amp;amp;amp;position=1"&gt;Designed by pch.vector / Freepik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When developing a new idea, being for a personal project, creating a startup, or even implementing a new feature within an existing project, we want to go as fast as possible to production and start gathering feedback. While this is a good idea, going to production without a plan could be harmful as the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-impressions-human-automaticity/"&gt;first interaction with your application is critical&lt;/a&gt;. Users will probably not come back if they find your application or website badly designed, laggy, or even unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the aforementioned issue, you need to design your software carefully. Designing software systems is an important part of software engineering and is also very present in job interviews. This practice covers a lot of subjects, technical or not. For instance, you will have to take into account user experience, metrics, scalability, availability, responsiveness, and more. Thinking about everything at once may become anxiety-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid getting stuck by the apparent complexity of system design, this series of articles proposes a thinking process and tradeoffs to consider. While many decisions should be taken pragmatically, there is a personal take on this kind of exercise. As a result, it’s normal and even better if you feel the need to inject your personal beliefs into the giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="where-to-start"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to Start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, designing a software system is articulated around project management concepts that you can handle one by one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, you need to frame the project: highlight features that are critical, with a way to check if the goals defined by those features are well met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once framed, you will have to plan for the resources that your software will require to run correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resource consumption can help you determine the best software design to reduce issues in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this data, you will be able to make an informed decision about the technologies that fit best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series will be discussing distributed software systems as they are the most present nowadays and probably the most complex subjects to consider during the design. However, most of the concepts remain completely valid for non-distributed software systems, even for non-software projects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this process can be applied recursively inside each component of complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="you-do-not-need-to-master-everything"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Do Not Need to Master Everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the situation, you may have to only consider a subpart of these subjects, either alone or with a team. However, having at least some knowledge about the whole picture will help to make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you are designing a system for a new startup, you will have to dig through every subject, and probably even deeper than where this guide will leave you. However, you may have time to reach out for constructive feedback and even brainstorm the design with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, during an interview, your time will be limited. As a result, interviewers usually cover a subpart of those subjects. It’s okay to not master every subject, but you need to be aware of the knowledge you are lacking. During an interview, it usually comes a long way to express what you would try to learn to get insights on a decision you can’t take on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan of this series is to provide articles articulated around a specific subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article can be found on other sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with a production system, you may encounter errors at any point, originating either from an application or its underlying host.
While it may become natural for a seasoned engineer to pinpoint its origin, it can be overwhelming at times if you are unsure of where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article aims to provide a generic framework to tackle production issues.
The framework will serve as a basis for any engineer aiming to learn about troubleshooting basics.
However, as with any generic framework, it may need adjustments for specific use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="environment"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we consider that you are working on a project that already implements the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/best-practices-for-monitoring/"&gt;best practices in terms of monitoring&lt;/a&gt;
so that you have access to sensible metrics, defined for instance through the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://brendangregg.com/usemethod.html"&gt;USE Method&lt;/a&gt;.
Those metrics can be used to provide performance dashboards and declare alerts triggered in case of faulty or suspicious behavior.
For a more visual reference, the following diagram shows a basic monitoring architecture using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://prometheus.io/"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://grafana.com/"&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/"&gt;Alert Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Basic Monitoring Environment" src="/images/posts/2022-09-18_troubleshooting_basics/Monitoring_Environment.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon the reception of an alert for an issue impacting a production service, the actions to take can be broken down into three steps: &lt;em&gt;Analysis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Correction&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Post-Mortem&lt;/em&gt;.
As some of the traces found or produced during the incident can be transient, it is recommended to keep track of any event and action that was taken on the production during the analysis and correction phases.
This will ease the post-mortem phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="analysis"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="explore-the-issue"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explore The Issue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step when receiving an alert will be to find any known information about it.
Usually, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/what-is-a-runbook/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Runbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will explain the reason why this alert fired and the steps to take to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the solution seems simple, you may want to find the scope of the problem.
Your response might differ if the issue is impacting one or hundreds of hosts.
Likewise, an issue crippling production will require a low response time to issue corrective action,
while a less critical issue, like a decrease in performance, may give you more time for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While your production servers should behave in the same way,
in some cases you will need to investigate the error before being able to determine the actual number of impacted hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="check-the-basic-metrics"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Check The Basic Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have multiple hosts impacted, take one of them as an analysis host before you have a clear view of which metrics are important in the current case.
If you have the chance to have metrics exported to a dashboard, for instance through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter"&gt;node-exporter&lt;/a&gt;,
you will be able to see the issue quite easily from the different indicators.
Otherwise, you will need to jump on the host and use the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://linuxconfig.org/linux-basic-health-check-commands"&gt;usual tools&lt;/a&gt; to get more insights into the host's health.
In any case, you will be looking for issues with the CPU, RAM, Load, Disk, and Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first step will indicate if the issue is purely applicative, or if your server is over-used to some extent.
This will also help you reduce the scope of where to look further down the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the result of the previous check, you will need to look at the application-specific metrics,
both for performance through CPU and RAM usage, as well as applicative metrics such as response time, workload queues, and more.
You also need to check the applicative logs looking for anything that stands out of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, if you have enough information to at least recognize the issue and perform a temporary corrective action,
you should go for it and fix the production as soon as possible before digging Further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="dive-deeper-into-the-application-metrics"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dive Deeper into The Application Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't find the root cause of the error yet, you need to dig into the application behavior and its interaction with the system.
This step is mostly dependent on the application, but there are some common checks that could show irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the system side, you can take a look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network communications and connectivity (e.g.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tcpdump.1.html"&gt;tcpdump&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/netstat.8.html"&gt;netstat&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man1/telnet.1.html"&gt;telnet&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man8/mtr.8.html"&gt;mtr&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kernel and related logs (e.g.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html"&gt;journalctl&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html"&gt;dmesg&lt;/a&gt;, …)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the applicative side, you can take a look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The configuration through files and environment variables (e.g. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html"&gt;/proc&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opened file handles and connections (e.g. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsof.8.html"&gt;lsof&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system calls that are performed by the application (e.g. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html"&gt;strace&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application performances in a specific code path (e.g. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gdb.1.html"&gt;gdb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt;, …).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="correction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Correction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="protect-the-production"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protect The Production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to protect production from the issue as soon as possible.
This can take many forms but usually, you will either implement a quick fix,
that will enable the instance to still run until a long-term solution is implemented,
or isolate the faulty application from the production pools.
The latter can be done for instance by redirecting the load-balancer flow to other instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With orchestration solutions and stateless services,
it could be appealing to simply restart the application and use a brand-new instance.
This may work in some cases, but be sure to backup all data required for further investigation before doing so,
otherwise, you may end up in the same situation later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="implement-a-long-term-solution"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implement a Long-Term Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the production is secured, you can catch your breath and start digging further into the data you collected to find the actual root cause of the alert that was triggered.
Even if the situation is stable for now, you may want to improve the overall code quality so the &lt;em&gt;future you&lt;/em&gt; don't have to investigate this issue again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is entirely specific to the encountered issue, the actual fix could range from host configuration or code update to a complete architectural refactor in some cases.
I would advise performing the long-term fix as soon as possible, but you may be compelled to write down the Post-Mortem beforehand if the fix is big or impacts multiple components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="post-mortem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-Mortem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="write-the-actual-post-mortem"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Write The Actual Post-Mortem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/"&gt;Post-Mortem&lt;/a&gt; is to hold all relevant events and actions that took place during the incident.
This helps to understand the issue and improve the response process for future incidents.
It also helps fellow engineers to map potential side effects they experienced to the main incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the precise timeline, you need to describe the actual root cause from which the incident originates and the action you and your team are proposing to avoid this issue from recurring.
In case of a corrective action impacting multiple components, you will need to have this post-mortem reviewed by the right stakeholders before taking action.
The post-mortem should hold enough information for a peer to have a strong opinion about the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="improve-runbooks-and-alerts"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improve Runbooks And Alerts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the corrective action you took, you may need to create new alerts to cover different edge cases and modify the runbook sections with up-to-date data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the changes you performed are trivial, use this step as a feedback loop on the data you were missing during the investigation to help the &lt;em&gt;future you&lt;/em&gt; during the next investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article aims to provide a baseline of investigation in case of a generic production incident.
The procedure will not show you the error if you don't ask the right questions but defines a framework to help you find the right questions to ask, and where to write the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a picture is worth a thousand words, here is a summary of the article through a simple flow chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Illustration" src="/images/posts/2021-07-26_abstraction_computer_science/copilot.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science provides more and more abstraction layers with time, to the point that we don’t really know what’s running underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub recently released &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://copilot.github.com/"&gt;Copilot&lt;/a&gt; in technical preview.
Copilot is an AI-based assistant that will automatically generate code from the context of your application, with the aim of easing software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question that arises with simplification and automation in computer science is generally &lt;em&gt;“will the developer still be needed?”&lt;/em&gt;.
And every time it happened, the answer was &lt;em&gt;“yes”&lt;/em&gt;.
Abstraction in computer science reduces the cost of entering the domain, thus attracts a larger population.
But it also usually creates opportunities with new technologies, practices, and more complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short article aims to summarize the evolution of abstraction layers in computer science to help understand the impact that GitHub Copilot may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="a-bit-of-history"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Bit of History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example that seems the oldest and most sensible would be the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine"&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/a&gt;.
It was created with the specific idea to break the cryptographic code &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma"&gt;Enigma&lt;/a&gt;,
but the concepts behind it are now considered as a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness"&gt;ground reference of algorithmic capabilities&lt;/a&gt; for programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, we created processors, able to take a random set of instructions and process them generically.
Those instructions were originally described using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code"&gt;machine code&lt;/a&gt;, which is hard to manipulate for a human.
This is why programming languages of higher abstraction appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, we can describe the goal of a programming language as to &lt;em&gt;write human-readable specifications that can be converted into machine code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="evolution-of-programming"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evolution of Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming languages evolved from &lt;em&gt;low (abstraction) level&lt;/em&gt; languages to &lt;em&gt;higher levels&lt;/em&gt;, each iteration adding automation and helpers to the common operations.
Those abstractions can take many forms, from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29"&gt;garbage collection&lt;/a&gt; to libraries
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html?highlight=read#examples"&gt;reading CSV files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These evolutions enable developers to add more complexity to their software, as there is less complexity on the technical parts.
They can in turn abstract away even more for others. Thanks to this, taking on programming is becoming easier with time.
We even see some programming languages using almost natural languages (e.g. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html"&gt;Gherkin&lt;/a&gt;)
and requiring next to zero computer science knowledge to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that people will stop using languages with lower abstraction levels.
On the contrary, even if they are generally harder to master and more verbose, they can be way more flexible for some use cases,
memory management for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also note the appearance of Machine Learning, creating dynamic processes over data that would have been tedious to analyse, either by hand or through specific code.
This enables writing potentially complex behaviours with a few lines of code in some cases.
Even then, there is some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.google.com/automl"&gt;automation&lt;/a&gt; of it to the point where you only have to provide data to get working results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, having a minimum of knowledge on the layers underneath remains very important to really comprehend the code execution.
Otherwise, it would be difficult to adapt to issues that may, and will, arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="evolution-of-infrastructure"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evolution of Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about code, but the same kind of evolution happened on the servers too.
At first, companies were starting on personal computers until they could get a hold of some space in a datacenter, renting one or more &lt;em&gt;baremetal&lt;/em&gt; servers.
This was costly and required technical knowledge for both the installation and deployment processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtualization technology evolved to the point where you can now rent a &lt;em&gt;virtual machine&lt;/em&gt; hosted on a physical host anywhere through
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-are-cloud-providers"&gt;cloud providers&lt;/a&gt;.
This tremendously reduces the costs and enhances accessibility, but still requires technical knowledge to administrate correctly the machine on top of the deployments pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since more recently, the technology of &lt;em&gt;containerization&lt;/em&gt; is heavily used with powerful tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.docker.com/"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aveuiller.medium.com/kubernetes-apprentice-cookbook-90d8c11ccfc3"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.
Those tools can help you deploy applications on a VM without necessarily mastering the system underneath*.
In the same fashion as machine learning, there are projects aiming to further &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview"&gt;reduce the knowledge required&lt;/a&gt;
to use such technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, a new abstraction layer called &lt;em&gt;serverless&lt;/em&gt; is emerging.
This enables you to directly execute code on a remote container, without having to take care of the hosting problematics at all.
While this is currently mostly used for stateless operations, there are no doubts about the growth of use cases and tools around this ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Note: Those tools may be better used with knowledge on the underlying layer, but you can redirect your learning to a more practical proficiency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="a-glimpse-on-the-future-of-copilot"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Glimpse on The Future of Copilot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Copilot is a pretty interesting advancement in software engineering, even if not completely on point at the moment.
According to the FAQ, the system gets the generation right around 50% of the time, and it is recommended to stay wary of the generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look a bit differently on GitHub Copilot, we can consider this as a new programming language.
The input of this language is the documentation and function name and those are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transcompiler"&gt;transpiled&lt;/a&gt; into source code for another programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation is today limited to methods but we can imagine that this will evolve to classes or even packages.
We can also imagine the generation becoming almost flawless for well-known use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if everything is one day working on a larger scale and flawlessly, the generated code will still require developers to handle the direction it takes,
and connect the even bigger pictures altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regard to what we just saw, it makes no doubt that GitHub Copilot will further abstract development and ease the creation of software.
This breakthrough has the power to move the development industry, as other abstraction layers did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, developers will probably never lack opportunities, as the scope of the projects will get bigger thanks to this new abstraction layer.
The day to day work done as a developer may change, but developers will still be required for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of comparison, we already saw system administration positions evolve to SRE, still working on providing reliable hardware, but on a scale never seen before.
In the same way, developers may evolve to something close, adapting to the new tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform built over strong concepts.
Let’s dive into the possibilities it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kafka.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/a&gt; is a distributed event streaming platform built with an emphasis on reliability,
performance, and customization. Kafka can send and receive messages in a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/pub-sub-messaging/"&gt;publish-subscribe&lt;/a&gt; fashion.
To achieve this, the ecosystem relies on few but strong basic concepts,
which enable the community to build many features solving &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kafka.apache.org/uses"&gt;numerous use cases&lt;/a&gt;, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing messages as an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-vs-enterprise-service-bus-esb-friends-enemies-or-frenemies/"&gt;Enterprise Service Bus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking Activity, metrics, and telemetries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing Streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/event-sourcing-cqrs-stream-processing-apache-kafka-whats-connection/"&gt;Event sourcing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storing logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will see the concepts backing up Kafka and the different tools available to handle data streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="architecture"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behaviour of Kafka is pretty simple: &lt;strong&gt;Producers&lt;/strong&gt; push &lt;em&gt;Messages&lt;/em&gt; into a particular &lt;em&gt;Topic&lt;/em&gt;,
and &lt;strong&gt;Consumers&lt;/strong&gt; subscribe to this &lt;em&gt;Topic&lt;/em&gt; to fetch and process the &lt;em&gt;Messages&lt;/em&gt;.
Let’s see how it is achieved by this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="infrastructure-side"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure side&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently of the use, the following components will be deployed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One or more &lt;strong&gt;Producers&lt;/strong&gt; sending messages to the brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One or more Kafka &lt;strong&gt;Brokers&lt;/strong&gt;, the actual messaging server handling communication between producers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One or more &lt;strong&gt;Consumers&lt;/strong&gt; fetching and processing messages, in clusters named &lt;strong&gt;Consumer Groups&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One or more &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zookeeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instances managing the brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Optionally) One or more &lt;strong&gt;Registry&lt;/strong&gt; instances uniformizing message schema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a scalable distributed system, Kafka is heavily relying on the concept of &lt;em&gt;clusters&lt;/em&gt;.
As a result, on typical production deployment, there will likely be multiple instances of each component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Consumer Group&lt;/strong&gt; is a cluster of the same consumer application.
This concept is heavily used by Kafka to balance the load on the applicative side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kafka Architecture" src="/images/posts/2021-06-01_Kafka-Apprentice-Cookbook/kafka_architecture.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The dependency on Zookeeper will be removed soon, Cf.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KIP-500&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="applicative-side"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Applicative side&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Message&lt;/strong&gt; in Kafka is a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;key-value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pair.
Those elements can be anything from an integer to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers"&gt;Protobuf message&lt;/a&gt;,
provided the right serializer and deserializer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message is sent to a &lt;strong&gt;Topic&lt;/strong&gt;, which will store it as a &lt;strong&gt;Log&lt;/strong&gt;.
The topic should be a collection of logs semantically related, but without a particular structure imposed.
A topic can either keep every message as a new log entry or only keep the last value for each key
(a.k.a. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/design.html#log-compaction"&gt;Compacted log&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of the multiple brokers, topics are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_%28database_architecture%29"&gt;sharded&lt;/a&gt;
into &lt;strong&gt;Partitions&lt;/strong&gt; by default.
Kafka will assign any received message to one partition depending on its key,
or using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-producer-improvements-sticky-partitioner"&gt;a partitioner algorithm&lt;/a&gt; otherwise,
which results in a random assignment from the developer's point of view.
Each partition has a &lt;strong&gt;Leader&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for all I/O operations, and &lt;strong&gt;Followers&lt;/strong&gt; replicating the data.
A follower will take over the leader role in case of an issue with the current one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partition holds the received data in order, increasing an &lt;strong&gt;offset&lt;/strong&gt; integer for each message.
However, there is no order guarantee between two partitions.
So for order-dependent data, one must ensure that they end up in the same partition by using the same key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each partition is assigned to a specific consumer from the consumer group.
This consumer is the only one fetching messages from this partition.
In case of shutdown of one customer, the brokers will &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/streamthoughts/understanding-kafka-partition-assignment-strategies-and-how-to-write-your-own-custom-assignor-ebeda1fc06f3"&gt;reassign partitions&lt;/a&gt;
among the customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an asynchronous system, it can be hard and impactful on the performances to have every message delivered exactly one time to the consumer.
To mitigate this, Kafka provides &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics"&gt;different levels of guarantee&lt;/a&gt;
on the number of times a message will be processed (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; at most once, at least once, exactly once).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="schema-and-registry"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Schema and Registry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages are serialized when quitting a producer and deserialized when handled by the consumer.
To ensure compatibility, both must be using the same data definition.
Ensuring this can be hard considering the application evolution.
As a result, when dealing with a production system, it is recommended to use a schema to explicit a contract on the data structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, Kafka provides a &lt;strong&gt;Registry&lt;/strong&gt; server, storing and binding schema to topics.
Historically only &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/"&gt;Avro&lt;/a&gt; was available, but the registry is now modular and can also handle
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://json-schema.org/"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers"&gt;Protobuf&lt;/a&gt; out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a producer sent a schema describing the data handled by its topic to the registry, other parties
(&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; brokers and consumers) will fetch this schema on the registry to validate and deserialize the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="integrations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Integrations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kafka provides multiple ways of connecting to the brokers,
and each can be more useful than the others depending on the needs.
As a result, even if a library is an abstraction layer above another, it is not necessarily better for every use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="kafka-library"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kafka library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are client libraries available in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/index.html"&gt;numerous languages&lt;/a&gt;
which help develop a producer and consumer easily.
We will use Java for the example below, but the concept remains identical for other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producer concept is to publish messages at any moment, so the code is pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Configure your producer
    Properties producerProperties = new Properties();
    producerProperties.put(&amp;quot;bootstrap.servers&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;localhost:29092&amp;quot;);
    producerProperties.put(&amp;quot;acks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;);
    producerProperties.put(&amp;quot;retries&amp;quot;, 0);
    producerProperties.put(&amp;quot;linger.ms&amp;quot;, 1);
    producerProperties.put(&amp;quot;key.serializer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongSerializer&amp;quot;);
    producerProperties.put(&amp;quot;value.serializer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroSerializer&amp;quot;);
    producerProperties.put(&amp;quot;schema.registry.url&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;http://localhost:8081&amp;quot;);
    
    // Initialize a producer
    Producer&amp;lt;Long, AvroHelloMessage&amp;gt; producer = new KafkaProducer&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(producerProperties);
    
    // Use it whenever you need
    producer.send(new AvroHelloMessage(1L, &amp;quot;this is a message&amp;quot;, 2.4f, 1));
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is a bit more complex on the consumer part since the consumption loop needs to be created manually.
On the other hand, this gives more control over its behaviour.
The consumer state is automatically handled by the Kafka library.
As a result, restarting the worker will start at the most recent offset he encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Main {
    public static Properties configureConsumer() {
        Properties consumerProperties = new Properties();

        consumerProperties.put(&amp;quot;bootstrap.servers&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;localhost:29092&amp;quot;);
        consumerProperties.put(&amp;quot;group.id&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;HelloConsumer&amp;quot;);
        consumerProperties.put(&amp;quot;key.deserializer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongDeserializer&amp;quot;);
        consumerProperties.put(&amp;quot;value.deserializer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroDeserializer&amp;quot;);
        consumerProperties.put(&amp;quot;schema.registry.url&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;http://localhost:8081&amp;quot;);
        // Configure Avro deserializer to convert the received data to a SpecificRecord (i.e. AvroHelloMessage)
        // instead of a GenericRecord (i.e. schema + array of deserialized data).
        consumerProperties.put(KafkaAvroDeserializerConfig.SPECIFIC_AVRO_READER_CONFIG, true);

        return consumerProperties;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Initialize a consumer
        final Consumer&amp;lt;Long, AvroHelloMessage&amp;gt; consumer = new KafkaConsumer&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(configureConsumer());

        // Chose the topics you will be polling from.
        // You can subscribe to all topics matching a Regex.
        consumer.subscribe(Pattern.compile(&amp;quot;hello_topic_avro&amp;quot;));

        // Poll will return all messages from the current consumer offset
        final AtomicBoolean shouldStop = new AtomicBoolean(false);
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(() -&amp;gt; {
            final Duration timeout = Duration.ofSeconds(5);

            while (!shouldStop) {
                for (ConsumerRecord&amp;lt;Long, AvroHelloMessage&amp;gt; record : consumer.poll(timeout)) {
                    // Use your record
                    AvroHelloMessage value = record.value();
                }
                // Be kind to the broker while polling
                Thread.sleep(5);
            }

            consumer.close(timeout);
        });

        // Start consuming &amp;amp;&amp;amp; do other things
        consumerThread.start();
        // [...]

        // End consumption from customer
        shouldStop.set(true);
        consumerThread.join();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="kafka-streams"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kafka Streams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kafka Streams is built on top of the consumer library.
It continuously reads from a topic and processes the messages with code declared with a functional DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the processing, transitional data can be kept in structures called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kafka.apache.org/23/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html"&gt;KStream&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kafka.apache.org/23/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KTable.html"&gt;KTable&lt;/a&gt;,
which are stored into topics. The former is equivalent to a standard topic, and the latter to a compacted topic.
Using these data stores will enable automatic tracking of the worker state by Kafka, helping to get back on track in case of restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following code sample is extracted from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kafka.apache.org/28/documentation/streams/tutorial"&gt;tutorial provided by Apache&lt;/a&gt;.
The code connects to a topic named &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;streams-plaintext-input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; containing strings values, without necessarily providing keys.
The few lines configuring the &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;StreamsBuilder&lt;/span&gt; will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transform each message to lowercase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Split the result using whitespaces as a delimiter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group previous tokens by value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Count the number of tokens for each group and save the changes to a KTable named &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;counts-store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stream the changes in this Ktable to send the values in a KStream named &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;streams-wordcount-output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Main {

&lt;section id="kafka-connect"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kafka Connect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kafka Connect provides a way of transforming and synchronizing data between almost any technology with the use of &lt;strong&gt;Connectors&lt;/strong&gt;.
Confluent is hosting a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.confluent.io/hub/"&gt;Hub&lt;/a&gt;, on which users can share connectors for various technologies.
This means that integrating a Kafka Connect pipeline is most of the time only a matter of configuration, without code required.
A single connector can even handle both connection sides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populate a topic with data from any system: &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send data from a topic to any system: &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;Sink&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source will read data from CSV files in the following schema then publish them into a topic.
Concurrently, the sink will poll from the topic and insert the messages into a MongoDB database.
Each connector can run in the same or a distinct worker, and workers can be grouped into a cluster for scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kafka Connect Example" src="/images/posts/2021-06-01_Kafka-Apprentice-Cookbook/kafka_connect.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connector instance is created through a configuration specific to the library.
The file below is a configuration of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.confluent.io/hub/mongodb/kafka-connect-mongodb"&gt;MongoDB connector&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Once the configuration complete, registering the connector is as easy as an HTTP call on the running &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.confluent.io/home/connect/userguide.html#configuring-and-running-workers"&gt;Kafka Connect instance&lt;/a&gt;.
Afterwards, the service will automatically watch the data without further work required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-X&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;POST&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Accept:application/json&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Content-Type:application/json&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;http://localhost:8083/connectors&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-d&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#64;sink-conf.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;section id="ksql-database"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;KSQL Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ksql is somehow equivalent to Kafka Streams, except that every transformation is declared in an SQL-like language.
The server is connected to the brokers and can create &lt;strong&gt;Streams&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Tables&lt;/strong&gt; from topics.
Those two concepts behave in the same way as a KStream or KTable from Kafka Streams (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; respectively a topic and a compacted topic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of query in the language definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Query&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;CREATE TABLE &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; WITH &lt;span class="pre"&gt;(...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;): Creates a new stream or table that will be automatically updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull Query&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;SELECT * FROM &amp;lt;table|stream&amp;gt; WHERE ID = 1&lt;/span&gt;): Behaves similarly to a standard DBMS. Fetches data as an instant snapshot and closes the connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push Query&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;SELECT * FROM &amp;lt;table|stream&amp;gt; EMIT CHANGES&lt;/span&gt;): Requests a persistent connection to the server, asynchronously pushing updated values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database can be used to browse the brokers' content. Topics can be discovered through the command &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;list topics&lt;/span&gt;, and their content displayed using &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;print &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code sql literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ksql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;topics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Kafka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Partitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Partition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Replicas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;----------------------------------------------------
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello_topic_json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;----------------------------------------------------
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ksql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'hello_topic_json'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;beginning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rowtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;970&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;user_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;this is another message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;version&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax to create and query a stream, or a table is very close to SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code sql literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Let's create a table from the previous topic
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ksql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;BIGINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Appart from some additions to the language, the queries are almost declared in standard SQL. 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ksql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;EMIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CHANGES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;--------+------------------------+
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;USER_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MESSAGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;--------+------------------------+
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;another&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;another&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kafka recommends using a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/deep-dive-ksql-deployment-options/"&gt;headless ksqlDB server&lt;/a&gt;
for production, with a file declaring all streams and tables to create.
This avoids any modification to the definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: ksqlDB servers can be grouped in a cluster like any other consumer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably already heard of &lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/strong&gt;, a powerful &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-orchestration"&gt;orchestrator&lt;/a&gt;
that will ease deployment and automatically manage your applications on a set of machines, called a &lt;em&gt;Cluster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great power comes great complexity, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/25/google_kubernetes_autopilot/"&gt;even in the eyes of Google&lt;/a&gt;.
Thus, learning Kubernetes is oftentimes considered as cumbersome and complex, namely because of the number of new concepts you have to learn.
On the other hand, those very same concepts can be found in other orchestrators.
As a result, mastering them will ease your onboarding on other orchestrators, such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/"&gt;Docker Swarm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this article is to explain the most used concepts of Kubernetes relying on basic system administration concepts,
then use some of these to deploy a simple web server and showcase the interactions between the different resources.
Lastly, I will lay out the usual CLI interactions while working with Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article mainly focuses on the developer side of a Kubernetes cluster, but I will leave some resources about cluster administration at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="terminology-and-concepts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terminology and concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="architecture"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes realm is the &lt;strong&gt;cluster&lt;/strong&gt;, everything needed is contained within this cluster.
Inside it, you will find two types of nodes:
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components"&gt;Control Plane&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/"&gt;Worker Nodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;control plane&lt;/strong&gt; is a centralized set of processes that manages the cluster resources, load balance, health, and more.
A Kubernetes cluster usually has multiple controller nodes for availability and load balancing purposes.
As a developer, you will most likely interact through the API gateway for interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;worker node&lt;/strong&gt; is any kind of host running a local Kubernetes agent &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/"&gt;Kubelet&lt;/a&gt;
and a communication process &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/"&gt;Kube-Proxy&lt;/a&gt;.
The former handles the operations commanded by the &lt;strong&gt;control plane&lt;/strong&gt; on the local container runtime (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; docker),
while the latter redirects connectivity to the right pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kubernetes Architecture" src="/images/posts/2021-05-10_Kubernetes-Apprentice-Cookbook/kube_components.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="namespaces"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Namespaces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time, a Kubernetes cluster may become huge and heavily used.
In order to keep things well organized, Kubernetes created the concept of &lt;strong&gt;Namespace&lt;/strong&gt;.
A namespace is basically a virtual cluster inside the actual cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the resources will be contained inside a namespace, thus unaware of resources from other namespaces.
Only a few kinds of resources are completely agnostic of namespaces, and they define computational power or storage sources (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; Nodes and PersistentVolumes).
However, access to those can be limited by namespace using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/"&gt;Quotas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namespace-aware resources will always be contained in a namespace as Kubernetes creates and uses a namespace named &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; if nothing is specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Namespace Organization" src="/images/posts/2021-05-10_Kubernetes-Apprentice-Cookbook/kube_namespace.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet on the way to use namespaces, as it widely depends on your organization and needs.
However, we can note some usual namespaces usages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divide the cluster by team or project, to avoid naming conflict and help repartition of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divide the cluster by environment (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; dev, staging, prod), to keep a consistent architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploy with more granularity (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html"&gt;blue/green deployment&lt;/a&gt;), to quickly fall back on an untouched working environment in case of issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces/"&gt;Manage The Cluster Namespaces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="glossary"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glossary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes did a great work of remaining agnostic of any technology in their design.
This means two things:  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/"&gt;handle multiple technologies under the hood&lt;/a&gt;
and there is a whole new terminology to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, these concepts are pretty straightforward and can most of the time be compared to a unit element of classic system infrastructure.
The table below will summarize the binding of the most basic concepts.
The comparison might not be a hundred per cent accurate but rather here to help understand the need behind each concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstraction Layer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical Layer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uses Namespace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/"&gt;Pod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Container&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pod is the minimal work unit of Kubernetes, it is generally equivalent to one applicative container but it can be composed of multiple ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/"&gt;Replicaset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load Balancing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ReplicaSet keeps track of and maintain the amount of instances expected and running for a given pod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/"&gt;Deployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Deployment keeps track of and maintain the required configuration for a pod and replicaset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/"&gt;StatefulSet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A StatefulSet is a Deployment with insurance on the start order and volume binding, to keep state consistent in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/"&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Host&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;❌&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Node can be a physical or virtual machine that is ready to host pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/"&gt;Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Service will define an entrypoint to a set of pods semantically tied together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/"&gt;Ingress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reverse Proxy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ingress publishes Services outside the Cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/#design"&gt;Cluster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datacenter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;❌&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Cluster is the set of available nodes, including the Kubernetes controllers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/"&gt;Namespace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;➖&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Namespace defines an isolated pseudo cluster in the current cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/"&gt;StorageClass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;❌&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A StorageClass configures filesystems sources that can be used to dynamically create PersistentVolumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/"&gt;PersistentVolume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disk Partition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;❌&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PersistentVolume describe any kind of filesystem ready to be mounted on a pod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims"&gt;PersistentVolumeClaim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PersistentVolumeClaim binds a PersistentVolume to a pod, which can then actively use it while running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/"&gt;ConfigMap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment Variables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ConfigMap defines widely accessible properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/"&gt;Secret&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secured Env. Var.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;✅&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Secret defines widely accessible properties with potential encryption and access limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;section id="definition-files"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resources in Kubernetes are created in a declarative fashion, and while it is possible to configure your application deployment through the command line,
a good practice is to keep track of the resource definitions in a versioned environment.
Sometimes named &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gitops.tech/"&gt;GitOps&lt;/a&gt;, this practice is not only applicable for Kubernetes but widely applied for delivery systems,
backed up by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/"&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt; movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this effect, Kubernetes proposes a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html"&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt; representation of the resource declaration, and its structure can be summarized as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;File type&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;All files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version to use while parsing the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;All files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type of resource that the file is describing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;All files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resource identification and labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data centric files (Secret, ConfigMap)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content entry point for data mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most files (Pod, Deployment, Ingress, ...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content entry point for resource configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch out: some resources such as StorageClass do no use a single entry point as described above&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html"&gt;Yaml Specifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;section id="metadata-and-labels"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Metadata and labels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metadata entry is critical while creating any resource as it will enable Kubernetes and yourself to easily identify and select the resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this entry, you will define a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; and a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; (defaults to &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;),
thanks to which the control plane will automatically be able to tell if the file is a new addition to the cluster or the revision of a previously loaded file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of those elements, you can define a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt; section.
It is composed of a set of key-value pairs to narrow down the context and content of your resource.
Those labels can later be used in almost any CLI commands through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors"&gt;Selectors&lt;/a&gt;.
As those entries are not used in the core behavior of Kubernetes,
you can use any name you want, even if Kubernetes defines some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/"&gt;best practices recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can also create an &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;annotations&lt;/span&gt; section, which is almost identical to &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt; but not used by Kubernetes at all.
Those can be used on the applicative side to trigger behaviors or simply add data to ease debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# &amp;lt;metadata&amp;gt; narrows down selection and identify the resource
metadata:
  # The &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; entry is required and used to identify the resource
  name: my-resource
  namespace: my-namespace-or-default
  # &amp;lt;labels&amp;gt; is optional but often needed for resource selection
  labels:
    app: application-name
    category: back
  # &amp;lt;annotations&amp;gt; is optional and not needed for the configuration of Kubernetes
  annotations:
    version: 4.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="data-centric-configuration-files"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data centric configuration files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those files define key-value mappings that can be used later in other resources.
Usually, those resources (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; Secrets and ConfigMap) are loaded before anything else,
as it is more likely than not that your infrastructure files are dependent on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: v1
# &amp;lt;kind&amp;gt; defines the resource described in this file
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  # &amp;lt;data&amp;gt; configures data to load
  configuration_key: &amp;quot;configuration_value&amp;quot;
  properties_entry: |
    # Any multiline content is accepted
    multiline_config=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="infrastructure-centric-configuration-files"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure centric configuration files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those files define the infrastructure to deploy on the cluster, potentially using content from the data files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: v1
# &amp;lt;kind&amp;gt; defines the resource described in this file
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-web-server
spec:
  # &amp;lt;spec&amp;gt; is a domain specific description of the resource.
  # The specification entries will be very different from one kind to another
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="resources-definition"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will take a closer look at the configuration of the most used resources on a Kubernetes application.
This is also the occasion to showcase the interactions between resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the section, we will have a running Nginx server and will be able to contact the server from outside the cluster.
The following diagram summarizes the intended state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Intended Deployment" src="/images/posts/2021-05-10_Kubernetes-Apprentice-Cookbook/kube_nginx.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="configmap"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ConfigMap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConfigMap is used to hold properties that can be used later in your resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: simple-web-config
  namespace: default
data:
  configuration_key: &amp;quot;Configuration value&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration defined above can then be &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#configmaps-and-pods"&gt;selected from another resource definition&lt;/a&gt; with the following snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;valueFrom:
  configMapKeyRef:
    name: simple-web-config
    key: configuration_key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: ConfigMaps are only available in the namespace in which they are defined.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/"&gt;ConfigMap Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="secret"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Secret&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sensitive data should be put in Secret files (e.g. API keys, passphrases, …).
By default, the data is simply held as base64 encoded values without encryption.
However, Kubernetes proposes ways of mitigating leakage risks by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/"&gt;integrating a Role-Based Access Control&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/"&gt;encrypting secrets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secret file defines a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; key at its root, which can be used to add validation on the keys declared in the &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; entry.
By default, the type is set to &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;Opaque&lt;/span&gt; which does not validate the entries at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: simple-web-secrets
# Opaque &amp;lt;type&amp;gt; can hold generic secrets, so no validation will be done.
type: Opaque
data:
  # Secrets should be encoded in base64
  secret_configuration_key: &amp;quot;c2VjcmV0IHZhbHVl&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret defined above can then be &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-environment-variables"&gt;selected from another resource definition&lt;/a&gt; with the following snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;valueFrom:
  secretKeyRef:
    name: simple-web-secrets
    key: secret_configuration_key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Secrets are only available in the namespace in which they are defined.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="pod"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pod&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pod definition file is pretty straightforward but can become pretty big due to the quantity of configuration available.
The &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt; fields are the only mandatory ones, but you might commonly use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt; to define the ports to open on both the container and pod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt; to define the environment variables to load on the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;entrypoint&lt;/span&gt; to customize the container startup sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pods are usually not created as standalone resources on Kubernetes,
as the best practice indicates to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#working-with-pods"&gt;use pod as part of higher level definition&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; Deployment).
In those cases, the Pod file's content will simply be embedded in the other resource's file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-web-server
spec:
  # &amp;lt;containers&amp;gt; is a list of container definition to embed in the pod
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - name: web
          containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
      env:
        - name: SOME_CONFIG
          # Create a line &amp;quot;value: &amp;lt;config_entry&amp;gt;&amp;quot; from the ConfigMap data
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: simple-web-config
              key: configuration_key
        - name: SOME_SECRET
          # Create a line &amp;quot;value: &amp;lt;config_entry&amp;gt;&amp;quot; from the Secret data
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: simple-web-secrets
              key: secret_configuration_key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Pods are only available in the namespace in which they are defined.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.21/#podspec-v1-core"&gt;Fields available in Pod &amp;lt;spec&amp;gt; entry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.21/#container-v1-core"&gt;Fields available in Pod &amp;lt;containers&amp;gt; entry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="deployment"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deployment is generally used as the atomic working unit since it will automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a pod definition based on the &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a ReplicaSet on pods selected by the &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt; entry, with the value of &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;replicas&lt;/span&gt; as a count of pods that should be running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following file requests 3 instances of an Nginx server running at all times.
The file may look a bit heavy, but most of it is the Pod definition copied from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-web-server-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: webserver

  # &amp;lt;selector&amp;gt; should retrieve the Pod defined below, and possibly more
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webserver
      instance: nginx-ws-deployment
  # &amp;lt;replicas&amp;gt; asks for 3 pods running in parallel at all time
  replicas: 3
  # The content of &amp;lt;template&amp;gt; is a Pod definition file, without &amp;lt;apiVersion&amp;gt; nor &amp;lt;kind&amp;gt;
  template:
    metadata:
      name: my-web-server
      namespace: default
      labels:
        app: webserver
        instance: nginx-ws-deployment

              containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
          env:

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="service"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pod might be deleted and recreated at any time.
When it occurs the pod's IP address will change, which could result in a loss of connection if you are directly contacting it.
To solve this issue, a Service provides a stable contact point to a set of Pods, while remaining agnostic of their state and configuration.
Usually, Pods are chosen to be part of a Service through a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt; entry, thus based on its &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;.
A Pod is selected if and only if all the labels in the selector are worn by the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of services that are acting quite differently, among which you can select using the type entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;ClusterIP&lt;/strong&gt; service is bound to an internal IP from the cluster, hence only internally reachable.
This is the type of service created by default and is suitable for binding different applications inside the same cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;NodePort&lt;/strong&gt; service will bind a port (by default in range 30000 to 32767) on the nodes hosting the selected pods.
This enables you to contact the service directly through the node IP.
That also means that your service will be as accessible as the virtual or physical machines hosting those pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Using NodePort can pose security risks, as it enables a direct connection from outside the cluster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;LoadBalancer&lt;/strong&gt; service will automatically create a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/"&gt;load balancer&lt;/a&gt;
instance from the cloud service provider on which the cluster is running.
This load balancer is created outside the cluster but will automatically be bound to the nodes hosting the selected pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an easy way to expose your service but can end up being costly as each service will be managed by a single load balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are setting up your own Ingress as we will do here, you may want to use a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ClusterIp&lt;/span&gt; service, as other services are made for specific use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: simple-web-service-clusterip
spec:
  # ClusterIP is the default service &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;
  type: ClusterIP
  # Select all pods declaring a &amp;lt;label&amp;gt; entry &amp;quot;app: webserver&amp;quot;
  selector:
    app: webserver
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      # &amp;lt;port&amp;gt; is the port to bind on the service side
      port: 80
      # &amp;lt;targetPort&amp;gt; is the port to bind on the Pod side
      targetPort: 80
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Services are defined in a namespace but can be contacted from other namespaces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ingress"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ingress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingress enables you to publish internal services without necessarily using a load balancer from cloud service providers.
You usually need only one ingress per namespace, where you can bind as many routing &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt; as you want.
A backend will typically be an internally routed &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ClusterIP&lt;/span&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that Kubernetes does not handle ingress resources by itself and relies on third-party implementations.
As a result, you will have to choose and install an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/"&gt;Ingress Controller&lt;/a&gt;
before using any ingress resource.
On the other hand, it makes the ingress resource customizable depending on the needs of your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Ingresses are defined in the namespace but may contact services from other namespaces and are publicly accessible outside the cluster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section id="create-and-manage-resources"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create and manage resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section showcases the basic CLI commands to manipulate resources.
As said before, while it is possible to manually manage resources, a better practice is to use files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# &amp;lt;kind&amp;gt; is the type of resource to create (e.g. deployment, secret, namespace, quota, ...)
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;create&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;kind&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;edit&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;kind&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;delete&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;kind&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# All those commands can be used through a description file.
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;create&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;resource&amp;gt;.yaml&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;edit&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;resource&amp;gt;.yaml&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;delete&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;resource&amp;gt;.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ease resources manipulations through files, you can reduce the interactions to the CLI to the two following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create and update any resource
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apply&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;resource&amp;gt;.yaml&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Delete any resource
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;delete&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;resource&amp;gt;.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;section id="monitor-and-debug"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monitor and Debug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;section id="fetch-resources"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fetch resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all resources running through the CLI using &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl get &amp;lt;kind&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
This command is pretty powerful and lets you filter the kind of resources to display or select the resources you want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: if not specified, Kubernetes will work on the &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; namespace. You can specify &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; to work on a specific namespace or &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;-A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to show every namespace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Fetch everything
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;all&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dig into a particular resource&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section will show you how to dig into resources.
Most of the required day-to-day operations are doable through the three following commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first command will give you the resource's complete configuration, using &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl describe &lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;lt;kind&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;Events:&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;Type&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;Reason&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Age&lt;span class="w"&gt;                 &lt;/span&gt;From&lt;span class="w"&gt;                      &lt;/span&gt;Message&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;----&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;------&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;----&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;----&lt;span class="w"&gt;                      &lt;/span&gt;-------&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;Normal&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;UPDATE&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;7m6s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x6&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;over&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;23h&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;nginx-ingress-controller&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Ingress&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;default/simple-web-ingress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important command is &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl logs &lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;lt;kind&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, as you might expect it shows you the resources' logs if applicable.
As the logs are produced by Pods,
running such a command on a resource above a Pod will dig through Kubernetes to display the logs of a randomly chosen Pod underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;logs&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;deployments/my-web-server-deployment&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Found&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pods,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;using&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pod/my-web-server-deployment-755b499f77-4n5vn&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# [logs]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is sometimes useful to connect on a pod, you can do so with the command kubectl &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;exec &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;pod_name&amp;gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; /bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;.
This will open an interactive shell on the pod, enabling you to interact with its content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# As for logs, when called on any resource enclosing Pods,
# Kubernetes will randomly chose one to  execute the action
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-it&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;deployment/my-web-server-deployment&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/bin/bash&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;root&amp;#64;my-web-server-deployment-56c4554cf9-qwtm6:/#&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ls&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# [...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this article, we saw the fundamentals behind deploying and publishing stateless services using Kubernetes.
But you can do a lot more complex things with Kubernetes.
If you want to learn more about it, I can recommend you to look at these resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/"&gt;Kubernetes reference documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install a sandbox locally with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/fr/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/"&gt;Minikube&lt;/a&gt;, and play with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/X48VuDVv0do"&gt;Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners - &lt;em&gt;TechWorld with Nana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manually bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way"&gt;Kubernetes The Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, there are multiple subjects I could not deeply talk about in this article and that may be of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the developer side:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/"&gt;Volumes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/"&gt;StatefulSets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/field-selectors/"&gt;Selectors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the cluster administrator side:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/"&gt;Operators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/"&gt;Access control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/"&gt;Secret encryption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/"&gt;Quotas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/"&gt;Network Plugins&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md"&gt;VPP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/weaveworks/weave"&gt;Weaveworks&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if you are interested in the ecosystem around Kubernetes,
you may want to take a look at the following technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/enterprise-kubernetes-with-openshift-part-one"&gt;Openshift&lt;/a&gt;
is wrapping Kubernetes with production friendly features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://helm.sh/"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;
is a charts manager for Kubernetes helping improve re-usability of configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/"&gt;ArgoCD&lt;/a&gt;
is keeping your Kubernetes Cluster up to date with your configurations from Git.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="appendix"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="resources-repository"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources' repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resources definitions used in this article are available in the following &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aveuiller/frameworks-bootstrap/tree/feat_integrate_kube/Kubernetes"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="cli-equivalents-docker-and-kubernetes"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CLI equivalents - Docker and Kubernetes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing containers with Docker and pods with Kubernetes is very similar,
as you can see on the following table describing equivalent operations between both technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Docker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running containers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;docker ps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl get pods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuration details&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;docker inspect &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl describe &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show logs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;docker logs &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl logs &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter container&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;docker exec &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; /bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;kubectl exec &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; /bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot"&gt;Spring Boot&lt;/a&gt; is a web framework built on top of the framework &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework"&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt;. It is designed for easier use and quicker implementation. It does so by configuring the application and its environment as automatically as possible. As a newcomer, I can say that it makes the framework really easy to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My learning led me to read most of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.2/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-structuring-your-code"&gt;reference documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which is well written and gives you a lot of insights into the internal behavior of Spring Boot. This documentation gives a lot of details, so this article aims to take the counter approach and pinpoint the concepts you will need to implement an API using Spring Boot. I will complement each section with a set of links to related documentation, may you want to dig further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, this document will be using version 2.4.2 of the framework, on a Java project using Gradle as the build system.
However, the information remains applicable to any compatible language and build system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will cover the following aspects of creating an API with Spring Boot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap the project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create REST endpoints&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handle errors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect to a persistence layer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paginate the results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test the application&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Package the Application&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="bootstrap-the-project"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bootstrap the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part may be the easiest, as Spring Boot is providing a package generator at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://start.spring.io/"&gt;https://start.spring.io/&lt;/a&gt;. We can select all required modules and retrieve an archived project with the build system, dependencies, and main application class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of this generator, to declare a RESTful API, our project should define the Spring Boot &lt;em&gt;starter web&lt;/em&gt; dependency.
The &lt;em&gt;starter&lt;/em&gt; dependencies are a set of ready to use features packaged by Spring Boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code groovy literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'org.springframework.boot'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'2.4.2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;implementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application’s main method should be contained in any class, on which we should apply the annotation &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;SpringBootApplication&lt;/span&gt;. This annotation is responsible for a lot of automatic configurations, namely the components injection and web server startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting the server is as simple as using the embedded command &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;./gradlew bootRun&lt;/span&gt;.
The server will start, but we don’t have any endpoint to serve at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.2/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-using-springbootapplication-annotation"&gt;&amp;#64;SpringBootApplication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.2/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter"&gt;List of starter dependencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="create-a-rest-endpoint"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a REST endpoint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a controller, we simply have to annotate any class with &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;RestController&lt;/span&gt;.
We can then configure any method inside this controller as an endpoint using &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;RequestMapping&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;RequestMapping&lt;/span&gt; help us configuring the endpoint by providing an URL, the HTTP verb, the expected data type, and more.
It can be applied both on a class and a method, the configurations applied on the class will be inherited by the methods underneath and the path concatenated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To control our endpoint status codes we will return a&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;, holding both the response message and &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;HttpStatus&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;RestController
&amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/hello&amp;quot;,
        consumes = MediaType.ALL_VALUE,
        produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public class HelloWorldController {
    
    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/world&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; index() {
        HashMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; output = new HashMap&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
        output.put(&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot;);
        return new ResponseEntity&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(output, HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt; will be automatically transformed to an HTTP response, using the &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;HttpStatus&lt;/span&gt; as response code and transforming the message to a JSON object.
On top of transforming &lt;em&gt;Maps&lt;/em&gt; to JSON objects, Spring Boot configure &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson"&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt; to map all &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; attributes or getters of any class to a JSON object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8080/hello/world&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;World&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;section id="advanced-endpoint-configuration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced endpoint configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a controller, we may want to define dynamic HTTP endpoints. To do so, the main annotations to keep in mind are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;RequestBody&lt;/span&gt; : Defines a body structure through a java Class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;PathVariable&lt;/span&gt;: Defines a variable subpart of the endpoint URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;RequestParam&lt;/span&gt; : Defines a query parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controller below showcases the three annotations with two endpoints, each returning a custom “Hello World” depending on the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;RestController
&amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/hello&amp;quot;,
        consumes = MediaType.ALL_VALUE,
        produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public class HelloWorldController {
    
    // The behavior is not representative of a typical POST request
    // and only here as a matter of example.
    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; greetFromBody(&amp;#64;RequestBody HelloBody helloBody) {
        HashMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; output = new HashMap&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
        output.put(&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hello &amp;quot; + helloBody.getName());
        return new ResponseEntity&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(output, HttpStatus.OK);
    }
        
    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/{name}&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; greet(&amp;#64;PathVariable String name,
                                                     &amp;#64;RequestParam(required = false,
                                                                   defaultValue = &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;) int amount_exclamation) {
        HashMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; output = new HashMap&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
        StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder(&amp;quot;Hello &amp;quot;);
        b.append(name);
        for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; amount_exclamation; i++) {
            b.append(&amp;quot;!&amp;quot;);
        }
        output.put(&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;, b.toString());
        return new ResponseEntity&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(output, HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}

class HelloBody {
    String name;

    public HelloBody() {
        // Used by Jackson
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endpoints defined above can be used as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8080/hello/jack?amount_exclamation=4&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Hello jack!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# -d automatically creates a POST request.
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8080/hello&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-d&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Content-Type: application/json&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Hello Bob&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-requestparam"&gt;&amp;#64;RequestParam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="handle-errors"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Handle errors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Spring Boot will return the HTTP code 200 for any successful request, 404 if the endpoint is not registered, and 500 for any error. We already saw that using &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt; enables us to override this behavior for successful requests, but we still need to handle error codes more finely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, we will define custom API exceptions that will be automatically transformed into HTTP codes.
This transformation is done by a class extending &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ResponseEntityExceptionHandler&lt;/span&gt; and annotated with &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;ControllerAdvice&lt;/span&gt;.
In this class, we can define methods to handle exceptions using the annotations &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;ExceptionHandler&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;ResponseStatus&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;ControllerAdvice
public class MyApplicationControllerAdvice extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    &amp;#64;ExceptionHandler(ApiException.class)
    &amp;#64;ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
    public void handleBadRequest() {
    }

    &amp;#64;ExceptionHandler(NotFoundException.class)
    &amp;#64;ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
    public void handleNotFound() {
    }
}

public class ApiException extends Exception {
}

public class NotFoundException extends ApiException {
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After defining the &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ControllerAdvice&lt;/span&gt; in your project, any exception thrown by your controllers will be parsed and transformed to the bound &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ResponseStatus&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;RestController
&amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/exception&amp;quot;)
public class ExceptionController {
    
    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/404&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; notFound() throws NotFoundException {
        throw new NotFoundException();
    }    
    
    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/400&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; badRequest() throws ApiException {
        throw new ApiException();
    }

    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/500&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ise() throws Exception {
        throw new Exception();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8080/exception/500&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8080/exception/404&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8080/exception/400&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our exception handling is very simple and does not return any payload, but it is possible to implement exception parsing in the methods of &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;ResponseEntityExceptionHandler&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="connect-to-a-persistence-layer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connect to a persistence layer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="configuration"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use a database, we will need the &lt;em&gt;Java Persistence API&lt;/em&gt; (JPA) package and the implementation of any persistence layer.
The former will install interface APIs, while the latter will provide the implementations and drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pinpoint the minimal changes required to switch between two distinct databases, we will show the integration with both &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html"&gt;H2&lt;/a&gt; at the same time.
First, let’s declare our dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code groovy literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;implementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Dependencies to your used dbms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;implementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;implementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'com.h2database:h2:1.4.200'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step is to configure the accesses in &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;application.properties&lt;/span&gt;. The property file is the first and the last time we will have to worry about our persistence configuration. In this file, the 3 lines commented out are the only part to change to switch from PostgreSQL to H2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code properties literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;spring.datasource.username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;spring.datasource.password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;spring.datasource.generate-unique-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Automatically create &amp;amp; update the database schema from code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:database_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;spring.datasource.url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/database_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;spring.datasource.driver-class-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;org.postgresql.Driver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;spring.jpa.database-platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL10Dialect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.2/reference/htmlsingle/#data-properties"&gt;Available properties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="define-a-model"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Define a model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining a model is as simple as using annotations defined on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317"&gt;JSR-317&lt;/a&gt;. These annotations are available through the package &lt;em&gt;javax.persistence,&lt;/em&gt; which is available through the JPA dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the code below creates a &lt;em&gt;Delivery&lt;/em&gt; entity. Our entity identifier is the field &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;, which will be automatically initialized and increased on each new saved entity in the database thanks to the annotation &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;GeneratedValue&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All attributes publicly available will be set into the JSON representation of the entity in the API responses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;Entity
&amp;#64;Table(name = &amp;quot;delivery&amp;quot;)
public class Delivery {
    &amp;#64;Id
    &amp;#64;GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    long id;

    &amp;#64;Column(nullable = false)
    &amp;#64;NotNull
    &amp;#64;Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    DeliveryState state;
    
    &amp;#64;Column(nullable = false)
    &amp;#64;NotNull
    String location;

    public Delivery() {
        // Used by Jackson2
    }

    public Delivery(&amp;#64;NotNull DeliveryState state, &amp;#64;NotNull String location) {
        this.state = state;
        this.location = location;
    }

    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public DeliveryState getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public void setState(DeliveryState state) {
        this.state = state;
    }
    
    public String getLocation() {
        return location;
    }

    public void setLocation(String location) {
        this.location = location;
    }
}

enum DeliveryState {
    PENDING, DELIVERING, WAITING_AT_ARRIVAL, RETURNING, RETURNED, PICKED_UP;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure consistency of our data class, we applied &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;NotNull&lt;/span&gt; validations from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303"&gt;JSR-303&lt;/a&gt;, these validations can be enforced on endpoints as we will see during the next section.
The constraints are contained in the package &lt;em&gt;javax.validation.constraints&lt;/em&gt;, available through the dependency &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;spring-boot-starter-validation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code groovy literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;implementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-validation'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="expose-the-model"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expose the model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To interact with our models, we have to define a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/2.4.2/api/org/springframework/data/repository/Repository.html"&gt;Repository&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;CrudRepository&lt;/span&gt;.
Doing so is as easy as extending the class with an empty class. Spring Boot will automatically implement functions to interact with the entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;Repository
public interface DeliveryRepository extends CrudRepository&amp;lt;Delivery, Long&amp;gt; {
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We annotate this component &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;Repository&lt;/span&gt; to make it available to dependency injection.
Then we can inject and use the repository in any class, for example directly in a controller.
Using&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;Autowired&lt;/span&gt; will automatically retrieve the &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;Repository&lt;/span&gt; declared above_._&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;_&amp;#64;Repository_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;_&amp;#64;Service_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;behave exactly as the main injection annotation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;_&amp;#64;Component_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;, it simply enables to mark a semantic difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;RestController
&amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/delivery&amp;quot;,
        consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE,
        produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public class DeliveryController {

    private final DeliveryRepository deliveryRepository;

    &amp;#64;Autowired
    public DeliveryController(DeliveryRepository deliveryRepository) {
        this.deliveryRepository = deliveryRepository;
    }

    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Delivery&amp;gt; post(&amp;#64;Valid &amp;#64;RequestBody Delivery delivery) throws ApiException {
        try {
            delivery = deliveryRepository.save(delivery);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new ApiException();
        }
        return new ResponseEntity&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(delivery, HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/{id}&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Delivery&amp;gt; get(&amp;#64;PathVariable long id) throws ApiException {
        Optional&amp;lt;Delivery&amp;gt; delivery = deliveryRepository.findById(id);
        if (delivery.isEmpty()) {
            throw new NotFoundException();
        }
        return new ResponseEntity&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(delivery.get(), HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the annotation&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;Valid&lt;/span&gt; to ensure that our constraints defined above are met on the sent &lt;em&gt;Delivery&lt;/em&gt; body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8080/delivery&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;-X&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;POST&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-d&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;PENDING&amp;quot;}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                  
&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:1,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;PENDING&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;location&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Budapest&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: H2 is an in-memory database so the data will be wiped out at each server restart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="paginate-the-results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paginate the results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section illustrates how well Spring Boot integrates some classic features of a web API.
To paginate the access to our previous entity &lt;em&gt;Delivery,&lt;/em&gt; we simply have to change the repository’s extended class from &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;CrudRepository&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;PagingAndSortingRepository&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;Repository
public interface DeliveryRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository&amp;lt;Delivery, Long&amp;gt; {
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository implementation provides a new method &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;findAll(Pageable)&lt;/span&gt; returning a &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;.
The class &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;Pageable&lt;/span&gt; configures the page and page size to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;RestController
&amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;/delivery&amp;quot;,
        consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE,
        produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public class DeliveryController {

    private final DeliveryRepository deliveryRepository;

    &amp;#64;Autowired
    public DeliveryController(DeliveryRepository deliveryRepository) {
        this.deliveryRepository = deliveryRepository;
    }

    &amp;#64;RequestMapping(value = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity&amp;lt;Page&amp;lt;Delivery&amp;gt;&amp;gt; index(&amp;#64;RequestParam(required = false, defaultValue = &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;) int page) {
        Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, 50);
        return new ResponseEntity&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(deliveryRepository.findAll(pageable), HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endpoint will then serve the whole &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt; object’s data upon request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code shell literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;localhost:8080/delivery&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;jq&lt;span class="w"&gt;                                                                                   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;↵&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;content&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;PENDING&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;location&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Budapest&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;section id="test-the-application"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test the application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Boot provides every tool to easily test controllers with a set of APIs and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object"&gt;mocks&lt;/a&gt;.
Mostly, &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;MockMvc&lt;/span&gt; will enable us to send requests and assert response content without having to worry about technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, we are testing the &lt;em&gt;POST&lt;/em&gt; endpoint from the section above. One of these tests is successfully creating a &lt;em&gt;Delivery&lt;/em&gt; entity, and the second one simulates an error coming from the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid relying on a physical instance of a persistence layer, we injected our DeliveryRepository instance using &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;MockBean&lt;/span&gt;, which creates and injects a mock of our component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;SpringBootTest
&amp;#64;AutoConfigureMockMvc
class DeliveryControllerTest {
    &amp;#64;Autowired
    private MockMvc mvc;

    &amp;#64;MockBean
    DeliveryRepository deliveryRepository;

    &amp;#64;Test
    void testPostDeliveryOk() throws Exception {
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; delivery = getValidDelivery();
        String body = mapper.writeValueAsString(delivery);
        MockHttpServletRequestBuilder accept =
                MockMvcRequestBuilders.post(&amp;quot;/delivery&amp;quot;)
                        .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                        .content(body);
        mvc.perform(accept).andExpect(status().isOk());
    }

    &amp;#64;Test
    void testPostPersistIssue() throws Exception {
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; delivery = getValidDelivery();
        String body = mapper.writeValueAsString(delivery);
        Mockito.when(deliveryRepository.save(Mockito.any())).thenThrow(new RuntimeException());

        MockHttpServletRequestBuilder accept =
                MockMvcRequestBuilders.post(&amp;quot;/delivery&amp;quot;)
                        .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                        .content(body);

        mvc.perform(accept).andExpect(status().is4xxClientError());
    }

    private Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; getValidDelivery() {

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="package-the-application"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Package the application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring boot also eases the application packaging either as a standalone jar or a docker image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create a ready to run &lt;em&gt;fat jar&lt;/em&gt;, execute &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;./gradlew bootJar&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build a &lt;em&gt;docker image&lt;/em&gt;, execute &lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;./gradlew bootBuildImage&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that docker does not like uppercase characters in the image name, but we can easily customize the image name and version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code groovy literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Only use lowercase on docker image name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;named&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;bootBuildImage&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imageName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;${rootProject.name.toLowerCase()}:${version}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Boot can be used with a handful of annotations and will manage most of the configuration for you.
However, most of the configuration can be overridden to provide your own behavior if necessary.
This makes it a good framework to design proof of concepts while keeping room for optimization if the project grows specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about the framework, I can’t stress enough the quality of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/"&gt;Reference Documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which gives really good details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to play around with some code, you can find all those concepts on an example delivery API &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aveuiller/frameworks-bootstrap/tree/master/SpringBoot"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests are an essential part of software development as they give a ground truth about the code sanity. As developers, we reasonably expect our unit tests to give the same results if the source code does not change. It can happen, however, that the result of a unit test changes over multiple executions of a test suite without any change in the code. Such a test is named a flaky test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flaky test is not dangerous &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; but reduces the confidence a developer can give to his test suite, diminishing the benefits of the latter. It is thus recommended to eradicate such issue as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, depending on the origin of the flakiness, one may find out only a few days, months or even years later that the tests are flaky.
It may be hard to dive back into those and find the root causes, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html"&gt;so usually, we tend to put those tests aside to make them less annoying or we rerun them until success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fingers crossed" src="/images/posts/2020-08-10_Introduction-to-Flaky-Tests-by-Example/fingers_crossed.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a real-world example of flaky tests and the logic behind their resolution. I will talk about two interesting cases I had the opportunity to fix during my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="storytime"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Storytime!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my career, I stumbled onto a couple of flaky tests issues. There are two instances that, in my opinion, are quite symptomatic of test flakiness, with quite different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples are voluntary adapted to a simpler context than the original ones to keep a short and focused article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="story-1-5-days-a-month-isnt-a-big-deal"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Story 1: 5 days a month isn’t a big deal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered a project where continuous integration was broken during the 5 first days of each month.
I was told that this wasn’t a big deal since we don’t need to deploy this project at the beginning of a month.
The priority of fixing those tests was so low that it has remained like this for years before we took the time to tackle this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;input_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Store the data along with the input date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# [...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;retrieve_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Retrieve all data from lower date to now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# [...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;compute_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Compute some statistics about stored data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arrow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'month'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;retrieve_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_compute_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Test method checking the behaviour of compute_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arrow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;add_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;add_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;stat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;compute_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;We retrieve the two data input&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faulty feature was computing statistics about the current month. As the developer creating the initial tests wanted to take all cases into consideration, he created a test that gave as input multiple dates relative to the current &lt;em&gt;datetime&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those inputs, one was &lt;em&gt;5 days before the current date,&lt;/em&gt; and the test was always computing the statistics as if it was part of the same month. As a result, it led to the tests being faulty at the beginning of each month. We can then imagine that the flakiness was detected under one to three weeks after the feature development and from then on, ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test is time-dependent because &lt;em&gt;compute_stats&lt;/em&gt; will call for the date of analysis itself. As a result, the computation will always be dependent on the current date. One way of fixing such issues would be to sandbox the execution of the tests in order to control the current date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, we wanted to rely on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/swlh/about-design-patterns-dependency-injection-ab9c1742d4aa"&gt;dependency injection&lt;/a&gt; and make &lt;em&gt;compute_stats&lt;/em&gt; ask for a month to compute the statistics. This would create an easy way of sandboxing the execution and also potentially open the door to new features. However, in this project, this wasn’t trivial to implement because there was a lot of code dependent on this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of doing so would be to inject the value directly to the method. Python has a very good library to sandbox the tests when using the built-in &lt;em&gt;datetime&lt;/em&gt; objects: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun"&gt;freezegun&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, and unfortunately for us, the project was using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; so this was not a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, and thanks to some previously well-thought environment on the project, we had a central method to provide the current date, which was initially intended to prevent the use of a wrong timezone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mixing this method to the awesome &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#the-patchers"&gt;patch decorator&lt;/a&gt; of python mock library (which is part of the standard &lt;em&gt;unittest&lt;/em&gt; library since 3.3), we solved the issue with a simple modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;input_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Store the data along with the input date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# [...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;retrieve_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Retrieve all data from lower date to now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# [...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;compute_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Compute some statistics about stored data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arrow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'month'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;retrieve_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_compute_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Test method checking the behaviour of compute_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arrow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;add_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sandboxing the execution to a given point in time, we ensured the reproducibility of the build at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="story-2-we-use-that-configuration"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Story 2: We use that configuration!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another project, while creating a new feature we happened to break tests unrelated to our changes. This case could have been tedious to pinpoint, fortunately, due to the project organization, we were certain that the new feature did not affect the code covered by the now failing tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code below is a synthetic representation of what happened, a global &lt;em&gt;config&lt;/em&gt; object was interacting with both the existing and new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Global state configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;existing_feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;common_entry&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Not configured&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Process [...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;our_new_feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;common_entry&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Not configured&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Process [...]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the isolation of the two features, we knew that the new tests had to be the ones creating a faulty global state. There were globally two possibilities for the faulty state.
Either the new test was injecting something new to the global state, or removing something essential to the existing test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test cases below were always run in the specific order &lt;em&gt;ConfiguredFeatureTest, ExistingFeatureTestCase&lt;/em&gt; before integrating the new feature, then in the order &lt;em&gt;ConfiguredFeatureTest, NewFeatureTestCase, ExistingFeatureTestCase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ConfiguredFeatureTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TestCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;setUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;entry&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;anything&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_configured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertIsNotNone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;entry&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;


&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExistingFeatureTestCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TestCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_feature_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;existing_feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;


&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NewFeatureTestCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unittest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TestCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;setUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;entry&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;anything&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;tearDown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_new_feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;our_new_feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the behaviour of the existing test, we ran it alone, both with and without the new changes. It appeared that the test was failing in both cases. This gave us the information that this test was using an existing global state, and that we might be cleaning this state. So we took a deeper interest in the &lt;em&gt;tearDown&lt;/em&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened that the global configuration was injected and cleared in our new test suite. This configuration was used but rarely cleared in other tests. As a result, the existing test was relying on the execution of the previous ones to succeed. Clearing the configuration removed the context required by the existing test, thus made it fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By “chance” the tests were always run in the right order for years. This situation could have been detected way earlier by using a random execution order for tests. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-randomly"&gt;It happens that python has simple modules to do so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix the tests and avoid this situation to happen in the future, we decided to force the configuration clearing in the project’s test suite superclass. This meant to fix a bunch of other tests failing after this but also enforced a clean state for all new tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="bonus-story-a-good-flakiness"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bonus story: A good flakiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the previous stories, where flakiness is obviously a bad thing, I also stumbled into a case where I found flakiness somehow beneficial to the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, the test intended to assert some data consistency for any instances of the same class. To do so, the test was generating numerous instances of the class with randomized inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test happened to fail during some executions as the inputs were creating a behaviour not accounted for by the feature. That enabled to extract a specific test case for the input and fix the behaviour in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree that edge cases should be analyzed during the development process, sometimes the input scope is too wide to consider all of them, let alone test all possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those cases, randomizing the input of a method that should keep a consistent output is a good way to assert the codebase sanity in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article showed some real-life examples of flaky tests. They were not the worst to track down, but they pinpoint the fact that flakiness can resurface at any time, even years after their introduction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once they appear, the flaky tests need to be fixed as soon as possible out of fear that the failing test suite will be considered as a normal state. The developers may then not rely on the tests suites anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flakiness is mostly due to non-deterministic behaviour in the code, in this article we had an example of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specific execution time&lt;/em&gt;. If the code is dependent on time, there may be failing tests at specific dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Randomness.&lt;/em&gt; Using random values in the main code or in the tests needs extra care or the behaviour may vary depending on those random values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modified global state.&lt;/em&gt; Using a global state in a project can create inconsistencies in tests if the state is not managed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some behaviour can help to limit the amount of flakiness that hides in the tests, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control your test execution environment&lt;/em&gt; to keep reproducible execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoid global states&lt;/em&gt; to minimize the side effects of environment settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Randomize the test execution order&lt;/em&gt; to determine dependencies between tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;section id="what-is-dependency-injection"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is dependency injection?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dependency injection&lt;/em&gt; (DI) is a very simple concept that aims to decouple components of your software and ease their integration and testing. It does so by asking for their sub-components instead of creating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this article, we will also mention &lt;em&gt;inversion of control&lt;/em&gt; (IoC), which is commonly used along with dependency injection. This pattern aims to avoid asking for implementations but rather interfaces while injecting dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will use a simple example in Java to present dependency injection but aims towards a technology-agnostic explanation of the concept and its advantages. Moreover, even if it is an object-oriented design pattern, you can still adapt the behaviour in many programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="lets-clarify-all-this-using-an-example"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s clarify all this using an example!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will present a weather service that shows an intelligible representation of the weather. In the current implementation, we rely solely on a thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="lets-start-without-dependency-injection"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let’s start without dependency injection.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Weather service without IoC" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aveuiller/design-tutorials/master/dependencyinjection/specs/classes_without_ioc.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the diagram, the &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt; is relying on a &lt;em&gt;Thermometer&lt;/em&gt;, which can be configured with a &lt;em&gt;TemperatureUnit&lt;/em&gt;.
Not using dependency injection will result in a code creating a new instance of &lt;em&gt;Thermometer&lt;/em&gt; in the service, and a &lt;em&gt;Thermometer&lt;/em&gt; configuring the &lt;em&gt;TemperatureUnit&lt;/em&gt; to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Thermometer {
  private final TemperatureUnit unit;
  
  public Thermometer() {
    this.unit = TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS;
  }
}

public class WeatherService implements WeatherContract {

  private final Thermometer thermometer;
 
  // This constructor is not using dependency injection
  public WeatherService() {
    this.thermometer = new Thermometer();
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s imagine that we want to use a &lt;em&gt;Thermometer&lt;/em&gt; configured to use Fahrenheit degrees instead of Celsius. For this, we add a parameter to switch between both units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public Thermometer(boolean useCelsius) {
  if (useCelsius) {
    this.unit = TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS;
  } else {
    this.unit = TemperatureUnit.FAHRENHEIT;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can also argue that the user of our program won’t always have access to an actual thermometer on their device, thus you may want to be able to fall back to another implementation in this case.
For instance, an API sending the current temperature in your area. Integrating multiple implementations inside the service could be done as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public WeatherService(boolean useRealDevice, 
                      boolean useCelsius,
                      String apiKey) {
  if (useRealDevice) {
    this.thermometer = new Thermometer(useCelsius);
  } else {
    this.thermometer = new ThermometerWebService(useCelsius, apiKey);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, initializing the service can be done as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void main(String[] args) {
  // Not using dependency injection
  WeatherContract weather = new WeatherService(true, true, null);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it is easy to use, our current version of the &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt; is not evolutive. If we take a closer look at its constructor, we can see multiple design flaws that will haunt us in the long run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constructor is choosing its &lt;em&gt;Thermometer&lt;/em&gt;. Adding a new type of Thermometer would require some parameter tricks to guess the implementation to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constructor is managing the &lt;em&gt;Thermometer&lt;/em&gt; constructor parameters. Adding the &lt;em&gt;ThermometerWebService&lt;/em&gt; forced us to add a new &lt;em&gt;apiKey&lt;/em&gt; parameter to it, even if unrelated to the &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, any change to any &lt;em&gt;Thermometer&lt;/em&gt; implementation may require changes on the &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt; constructors. This behaviour is unwanted and breaks the &lt;em&gt;Separation of Concerns&lt;/em&gt; principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="will-dependency-injection-improve-my-project"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Will dependency injection improve my project?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependency injection, associated with inversion of control, is a good way to cover this use case. It allows you to choose which kind of thermometer you want in your program depending on the situation. The following diagram gives a quick overview of our new architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Weather service using IoC" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aveuiller/design-tutorials/master/dependencyinjection/specs/classes_using_ioc.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;inversion of control&lt;/strong&gt; is represented in this diagram by the fact that our &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt; implementation is linked to &lt;em&gt;ThermometerContract&lt;/em&gt; rather than any of its implementations. That’s nothing more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;dependency injection&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt; will now take a &lt;em&gt;ThermometerContract&lt;/em&gt; in its constructor, requiring the block using the service to build an instance filling this contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class WeatherService implements WeatherContract {
  // We now use the Interface   
  private final ThermometerContract thermometer;

  // New constructor using dependency injection    
  public WeatherService(ThermometerContract thermometer) {
    this.thermometer = thermometer;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the initialization of a &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt; for both constructors will look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void main(String[] args) {
  // Using dependency injection
  TemperatureUnit celsius = TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS;
  ThermometerContract thermometer = new Thermometer(celsius);
  WeatherContract weather = new WeatherService(thermometer);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, our &lt;em&gt;ThermometerContract&lt;/em&gt; can be fully configured by an external part of the software. More important so, the &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t need to know any of the available implementations of &lt;em&gt;ThermometerContract&lt;/em&gt;, thus decoupling your software packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could seem like nothing important, but this simple switch of responsibility is critical leverage for multiple aspects of software design. It enables you to control the instance creation from your software entry point by chaining dependencies. You won’t have to take care of the instantiation until it is necessary. This behaviour could be compared to raised exceptions, that are ignored until taken care of in a significant context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="thats-all-there-is-to-dependency-injection"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;That’s all there is to dependency injection?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to know that even if you can find libraries that help you manage your dependency injection, it is not always necessary to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those libraries tend to cover a lot of cases thus be offputting to developers not comfortable with the pattern in the first place. In reality, they simply ease the instantiation of complex dependency trees and are not required at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following section is an example of injecting our service using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki"&gt;Guice&lt;/a&gt;, a dependency injection framework for Java made by Google. The concept is to reference bindings of every component you can inject in your program, so that the library can generate a class of any type, automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider that we have two implementations with the following constructors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class WeatherService implements WeatherContract {
  private final ThermometerContract thermometer;

  &amp;#64;Inject
  public WeatherService(ThermometerContract thermometer) {
    this.thermometer = thermometer;
  }
}

public class Thermometer implements ThermometerContract {
  private final TemperatureUnit unit;
  
  &amp;#64;Inject
  public Thermometer(&amp;#64;Named(WeatherModule.TEMPERATURE_UNIT) 
                     TemperatureUnit unit) {
    this.unit = unit;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;injection module&lt;/em&gt; should be configured to bind all needed interfaces to a given implementation.
It should also be able to inject any object without a specific interface, such as the enumerate &lt;em&gt;TemperatureUnit&lt;/em&gt;.
The injection will then be bound to a specific name, “&lt;em&gt;temp_unit”&lt;/em&gt; in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class WeatherModule extends AbstractModule {
  public static final String TEMPERATURE_UNIT = &amp;quot;temp_unit&amp;quot;;

  &amp;#64;Override
  protected void configure() {
    // Named input configuration bindings
    bind(TemperatureUnit.class)
      .annotatedWith(Names.named(TEMPERATURE_UNIT))
      .toInstance(TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS);
      
    // Interface - Implementation bindings
    bind(ThermometerContract.class).to(Thermometer.class);
    bind(WeatherContract.class).to(WeatherService.class);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the module can be used as follow, here instantiating a &lt;em&gt;WeatherContract&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void main(String[] args) {
  // Creating the injection module configured above.
  Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new WeatherModule());

  // We ask for the injection of a WeatherContract, 
  // which will create an instance of ThermometerContract
  // with the named TemperatureUnit under the hood.
  WeatherContract weather = injector.getInstance(WeatherContract.class);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such modules usually provide a good power of customization to the injected elements, thus we can consider configuring the injection depending on the available implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, using a library is not required when integrating dependency injection. However, this could save a lot of time and cumbersome code in big projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Show me some tests!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side effect of decoupling your code, the dependency injection pattern is a real asset to improve unit testability of each component. This section contains an example of unit tests for our &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said above, making &lt;em&gt;WeatherService&lt;/em&gt; asking for a &lt;em&gt;ThermometerContract&lt;/em&gt; enables us to use any implementation we want. Hence, we can send a &lt;em&gt;mock&lt;/em&gt; in the constructor, then control its behaviour from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void testTemperatureStatus() {
  ThermometerContract thermometer = Mockito.mock(ThermometerContract.class);
  Mockito.doReturn(TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS).when(thermometer).getUnit();
  WeatherContract weather = new WeatherService(thermometer);
  
  Mockito.doReturn(-50f).when(thermometer).getTemperature();
  assertEquals(
    TemperatureStatus.COLD,
    weather.getTemperatureStatus()
  );
  
  Mockito.doReturn(10f).when(thermometer).getTemperature();
  assertEquals(
    TemperatureStatus.MODERATE,
    weather.getTemperatureStatus()
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can then control our thermometer without a struggle from outside our tested class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dependency injection&lt;/em&gt; is a way of thinking your code architecture and can be simple to implement by yourself. In bigger projects, integrating a dependency injection framework can save you a lot of time in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dependency injection&lt;/em&gt; provides multiple non-negligible advantages such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Code decoupling&lt;/em&gt;: use the contracts and ignore implementation specificities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced testability&lt;/em&gt;: Unit tests almost become a pleasure to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Configurability&lt;/em&gt;: you can more easily swap injected instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
