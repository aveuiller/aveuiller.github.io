## Presentation

I am a software engineer specialized in backend development who tries to keep an eye on every aspect
of the information technology spectrum.

I aim to design elegant, maintainable and reusable software systems and deploy those using DevOps practices.

## Opensource

I try to redistribute to the opensource community as often as possible.
Here is an extract of repositories I created:

- [Use JavaScript in Android with ease](https://github.com/APISENSE/rhino-android)!
- [Deploy an Influx database on the fly to test your java code](https://github.com/APISENSE/embed-influxDB)!

## Blogging

In the same fashion as for open source, I aim to spread knowledge as much as possible.
I already wrote a few articles, and am still actively looking for subject to write about.

You can find my articles on [the website home page](/)!

## Career

I tried to experience as much work environments as possible.
At first, I wanted to find somewhere I would feel well; then it evolved to curiosity as each environment gave me new perspectives.
Thanks to that, I feel that I can be comfortable in any company size, and work on almost every subject around software engineering.

My experience in reverse chronological order can be summarized as follows:
