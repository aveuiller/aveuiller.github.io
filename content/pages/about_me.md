title: About Me
---

I am a software engineer specialized in backend development, but I try to keep an eye on every aspect
of the information technology spectrum.

I aim to design elegant, maintainable and reusable software systems and deploy those using DevOps practices.

## Opensource

I try to redistribute to the opensource community as often as possible.
Here is an extract of libraries I created:

- [Rhino-Android](https://github.com/APISENSE/rhino-android): use JavaScript in Android with ease!
- [Embed-InfluxDB](https://github.com/APISENSE/embed-influxDB): Deploy an Influx database on the fly to test your java code!

## Blogging

In the same fashion as for open source, I aim to spread knowledge as much as possible.
I already wrote a few articles, and am actively looking for subject to write about.

You can find my articles on the following websites, chose the one that suits you most:

- [This blog](/)
- [Medium](https://aveuiller.medium.com/)
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/aveuiller)
- [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/u/aveuiller)

## Career

I tried to experience as much work environments as possible.
At first, I wanted to find somewhere I would feel well; then it evolved to curiosity as each environment gave me new perspectives.
Thanks to that, I feel that I can be comfortable in any company size, and work on almost every subject around software engineering.

My experience in reverse chronological order can be summarized as follows:
